# Research notes: public-setting randomized/deterministic separation

Date: 2026-10-28

## Exact question

Find either (A) a public partial-feedback online-learning game with a fixed hypothesis class H and a single global target subfamily F such that randomized minimax regret is o(T) and every deterministic learner has Ω(T) minimax regret, or (B) a theorem ruling out every such construction.

The horizon quantifier matters. A result for one finite T does not establish asymptotic learnability. The sublinear upper bound must hold for all sufficiently large horizons with ratio regret/T tending to zero; the deterministic lower bound must hold with one positive constant (possibly depending on the deterministic learner if that is the chosen quantifier convention) for all sufficiently large horizons.

## Literature audit

Primary source: Shihao Shao, Cong Fang, Zhouchen Lin, Dacheng Tao, “Partial Feedback Online Learning,” arXiv:2601.21462v3, dated 2026-04-02. Section 5.2 explicitly says the existence of a randomized/deterministic learnability separation under public setting remains open. The same paper gives a different result: randomized learnability under oblivious setting can fail to persist under public setting (Theorem 19). The two statements must not be conflated.

A fresh search on 2026-10-28 did not find a later publication resolving the exact public-setting question. Search absence is not mathematical proof of open status.

## Why the global target matters

For one fixed target family F ⊆ H, the acceptable set at context x is the image {h(x) | h ∈ F}. A valid construction has to use the same F at every round. Merely selecting a different consistent hypothesis after each round is not sufficient.

The formal model in PublicSetting.lean and PublicSetting.v states this constraint. The complement-of-singleton instance uses H = ℕ^ℕ and a single family F = {h | for all t, h(t) ≠ excluded(t)}. It proves that all allowed sets are induced by this one family, and that a path equal to excluded labels loses exactly T for each horizon T.

## What has and has not been proved

Proved in source, subject to the CI actually passing:

1. An integer-scaled definition of sublinear and linear natural-valued regret.
2. A proof that one and the same regret profile cannot be both sublinear and linear.
3. Global consistency of the complement-of-singleton example for one fixed target family across all rounds.
4. An all-horizons calculation that a path matching the excluded labels incurs exactly T losses.

Not proved:

1. That the pathwise complement-of-singleton construction is an online adversary witnessing a lower bound for every deterministic policy under the exact timing rules.
2. Any o(T) regret upper bound for a randomized learner on a globally consistent target family in the public setting.
3. The requested randomized-versus-deterministic separation, or a no-go theorem.

The last two are the open mathematical core. The source intentionally contains no admitted proof, sorry, axiom, or fabricated existence theorem.

## Next mathematical step

First formalize the public protocol operationally: contexts and visible labels are chosen before the current random draw; public history and the single global target family are specified exactly; regret is defined relative to the comparator in the paper. Then prove either a uniform randomized upper bound and a universal deterministic lower bound from one such model, or prove the corresponding specifications inconsistent. The profile definitions alone do not bridge this semantic gap.

## Construction audit: why the obvious separation example does not transfer

The classical set-valued-feedback separation of Raman, Subedi, and Tewari (PMLR 247, 2024), Section 4.1, uses `Y = ℕ`, co-singleton sets `A_y = ℕ \\ {y}`, and constant hypotheses `h_y(x)=y`. A deterministic learner can be made wrong every round by choosing `A_{p_t}` after observing its deterministic prediction (p_t); the intersection of finitely many co-singleton sets is nonempty, while a learner uniform on `[T]` has expected loss at most one in total.

That proof is not itself a public **set-realizable partial-feedback** separation: for a fixed subfamily (F^\star) of constant hypotheses, the induced set (F^\star(x)) is the same at every context. The deterministic construction needs different exclusions (p_t) across rounds. The new Lean/Rocq lemma `constant_hypothesis_complement_exclusion_is_fixed` machine-checks this obstruction: if one constant-hypothesis family induces the co-singleton `Y \\ {excluded(t)}` at every round, then `excluded` must be constant.

The opposite extreme, the full product class (H=\mathbb N^{\mathbb N}), has enough coordinate freedom to let the terminal target family avoid every realized prediction while accepting each pre-draw witness. The existing bounded-support public attack formalizes this failure of randomized learning in that submodel. Thus neither the constant class from set-valued feedback nor the full product class yields the required public separation.

A valid positive construction would need an intermediate hypothesis class: enough adaptive structure for every deterministic learner to incur linear loss, but insufficient coordinate freedom for a public adversary to tailor a globally consistent target family to a randomized path. The current literature search and formal work have not established such a class or a theorem ruling it out. This is the remaining mathematical gap, not a Lean/Rocq build failure.
